🎯 **DevOps Consultant** with **14+ years** of experience designing, scaling, and automating cloud-native platforms across AWS, GCP, and hybrid infrastructures. I specialize in building Kubernetes-centric, GitOps-driven systems using tools like ArgoCD to enforce declarative, version-controlled deployments. My focus is on delivering secure, observable, and self-healing platforms that empower teams to ship software with speed, reliability, and confidence.

## 🛠️ Core Competencies

- ⚙️ **Kubernetes Platform Engineering**  
  Multi-cluster architecture, Helm/Kustomize templating, GitOps workflows with ArgoCD, dynamic autoscaling, and resource-aware workload placement.

- 🚀 **CI/CD Strategy & Automation**  
  Scalable pipelines with GitLab, Jenkins, and CircleCI. Reusable runners on GKE with performance-focused tuning. End-to-end delivery for apps, ML pipelines, and infra.

- 📦 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  Cloud provisioning with Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation. Modular, reusable codebases with a focus on DRY, composability, and auditability.

- ☁️ **Cloud Architecture**  
  Architected secure and resilient systems using AWS services (EKS, ECS, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch) and GCP resources (GKE, CloudSQL, Cloud Storage).

- 📡 **Observability & Telemetry**  
  Built production-grade telemetry stacks using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Thanos, and New Relic — driving root cause analysis and SLO monitoring.

- 🧠 **MLOps Enablement**  
  Architected on-prem and cloud-native ML infrastructure using Prefect, Kubeflow, and Ray. Reduced orchestration latency and manual ops for ML engineers.

## 🏆 Impact Highlights

✅ **80% boost** in deployment reliability with robust GitOps workflows  
✅ **64% faster** ML data pipeline execution via custom on premise Prefect + Ray platform  
✅ **40% increase** in parallel job throughput with K8s-native GitLab runners  
✅ **90% less manual effort** by codifying SQL + GCP infra with Terraform  
✅ **100% automation** of user onboarding via Argo Workflows  
✅ **Zero blind spots** in telemetry with full-stack observability across clusters
